### What is data engineering


Data Engineering is the practice of designing, building, and managing systems that enable the collection, storage, and processing of large volumes of data. It ensures that data is clean, reliable, and accessible for analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence.

#### Key Responsibilities of a Data Engineer
- Data Collection – Extracting data from various sources like databases, APIs, logs, and cloud storage.
- Data Processing & Transformation (ETL/ELT) – Cleaning, structuring, and transforming raw data into usable formats.
- Data Storage – Designing and managing databases, data lakes, and warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).
- Data Pipeline Development – Automating workflows using Apache Airflow, Spark, Glue, or Kafka.
- Performance Optimization – Ensuring scalability and efficiency of data systems.
- Security & Compliance – Implementing data governance, encryption, and access control.

#### Common Tools & Technologies in Data Engineering
- Big Data Frameworks: Apache Spark, Hadoop
- Data Storage: AWS S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL
- ETL Tools: Apache NiFi, AWS Glue, dbt
- Data Streaming: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL, Scala
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow, Prefect


### Types of Data
There are three primary type of data
- Structured data
- Semi Structured data
- Unstructured data 


### What is datalake 

A data lake is a storage repository that holds a large amount of data in its native and raw formats.
The data comes from multiple sources and can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
The main idea of a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state for future processing and analysis.

### What is data wharehouse 

A data warehouse is a centralized repository designed for storing, processing, and analyzing structured data from multiple sources. It is optimized for analytical queries and business intelligence (BI), enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions.
